    "## ðŸ”— **What Is CASCADE in SQL?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**CASCADE** is an **action rule** applied on **foreign key constraints** that **automatically propagates changes** (like `DELETE` or `UPDATE`) from a **parent table** to the **child table**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### âœ… **Use Case: Parentâ€“Child Table Relationship**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have two tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Departments** (Parent)\n",
    "- **Employees** (Child)\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Departments (\n",
    "    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    dept_name VARCHAR(50)\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM Departments WHERE dept_id = 10;\n",

    "\n",
