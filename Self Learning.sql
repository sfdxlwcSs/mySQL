#
In SQL, the
WITH clause (also known as Common Table Expressions
(CTEs)) is used to define temporary 
# result sets that can be referred to within a
SELECT, 
INSERT,
UPDATE, or
DELETE statement. These temporary tables are
only available for the duration of the query,
#  and they help make complex queries more readable and manageable.
